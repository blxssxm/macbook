All flights were delayed and wouldn't touch down
until 13 PM Eastern.\\

Above me, hanged the sky, poorly drawn and tuned down to the colour of dead-telly.
Its loose threads, stared back at me, continuing
the notion I held, that they looked nothing more than splodges of dirty
paint on clean canvas. And there seemed
to be a constant racket of murmuring,
just within earshot.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Yes, today was the day, I was set to leave.
The date was the 29$^{th}$ of February;
I'd just graduated from one of Britannia's
finest universities and was ready to be packed and shipped
into one of those dinky little office cubicles
they kept in the big city.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Having, shifted through years of state education
as a child, it felt only fitting to, with much
boyish glee, show Father my university scores.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
He had insisted, that I age 12, sit London's toughest of
secondary exams and be it no sooner, was to realise,
that he fostered a child who had little-to-no interest
in the rat race of scholarship seeking.
And if fate had it, was told one sombre afternoon
his son hadn't the guts to enlist in the great
teutonic exam.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
And after many tears and rows, I was to learn that
in the latter of my college years, I was due to visit one of
England's most prestigious of schools. And it was then.
That I realised, I had no place. Or interest, in high society.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It felt easy to feel rich in London, it was the capital after all
and just within a stones throw, you'd see great glimmers of poverty
and glimpses of fine grandeur.
%and the shyness of wealth.
But never, have I felt more out of place in my life.\\
I was given a host, a ``buddy''.\\
He was a few centimetres taller than me, but
perfectly chiselled and gave of a sort of greco-roman appearance.
He was one year younger than me, but took on the part of
man, much better than I could have shown up to be.\\
His name was Will. \\
It'd rained heavily that morning, and a mass-production pen
remained tucked away in the warmth of my blazer, only to
spoil and bleed all over the inner lining of my suit. So it was decided,
that upon departing from the coach, coupled with an ill-fitting
suit and ink stained hands, I was to feel as though
I had come out of an oil-rig, rather my own college.\\
It wasn't my shyness to wealth, nor was it their
abundance of it or the laughter, with long groans
between each chortle. It was something else that had left
a stain on my young mind.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Over the course of those final academic years, I had
developed what I could only describe as an unprevoked
and unimagined scorn, to every man I was to meet.\\
Yet, one man was exempt from my criticism.\\\\
Akbar.\\\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Yes Akbar, Akbar was exempt.
If tolerance, is an uneven circle of suffering,
then... There was something gorgeous about him in
the midst of it all, some heightened sense of alertness,
as if he was related to those
\textit{self-aware} simulations, locked up hundreds of
miles away.\\
When most registered men, did nothing more
than look away and raise a handkerchief to their
face, as if to politely protest your presence.
Akbar would waver you on and give it no second thought.
Those same men, took much apart into mere prattle
without practice and seemed only conditioned
to make permanent of decisions, on nothing else
but temporary emotion. Akbar had not. And to me, Akbar was more machine than man, in that sense.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In my worst of temperaments, I had snapped and yelled.\\\\
``What do you want Akbar? Money, Broads, Dames, Hookers...
There's loads of them downtown, you should go there one day.
Do a man like you some good''.\\\\
''I don't know... I want something that isn't this, old sport''.\\\\
This annoyed me to a great extent and I was just about done with his type of character.\\\\
He looked to me, as if all principle left my body, resumed his current task and continued
with his sanguine walk.\\
I knew what wasn't this. And I knew never to ask again.\\
No-Akbar, had turned out alright in the end.
What preyed on Akbar, was something I believed
every good man must be put through.
Before it be considered, that he be recognised for his actions.\\
If not for her, I'm certain his sort of character would be
taught to every newborn of our generation. He
was a gentleman in every sense of the word, capable solely
for her.\\\\

``You're laughing. We tipped over a cow and you're
laughing.'', I finally managed to let out after holding
onto borrowed breath for too long.\\\\
``Wh-y why, yes!'' he replied statically, ``We did!''.\\\\
And just like that, we found ourselves, on
the wet pasture floor, covered in mud and sweat.\\\\
``I-I''\\\\
I couldn't speak and we both waited a few minutes,
whilst we regained our breaths.
It wasn't until I was absolutely certain my heart wouldn't blow down its cage,
that we both got up and slowly began to admire
the great bovine, that had lain just besides us.\\\\
``So tell me, how much did the cab, charge to bring you here'' I asked.\\\\
``Just Â£65''.\\\\
``Sixty-five-pounds! Why, that's an absurd amount!'' I said, wheezing at the heels. ``You've go-t got to lowball these
things man! Otherwise you'll be know better than those goose-necks at boarding'' I said, this time with more breath.\\\\
``Now you're starting to sound like a Jew'' he said, flashing me a wide grin, before bursting
into a fit of laugher again.
He leaned over the metal fence and gave a smiling look.
It wasn't to be long, before our grandeur was to be interrupted.\\\\
``Houston's been delayed'' a husky voice called.\\\\
``Ay, so I've heard'' a younger voice replied.\\\\
``They given a reason yet?''' the older and tougher sounding voice replied asked.\\\\
``Nay, but I reckon it's something to do with the date''.\\\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There was a tread of footsteps, squelching on wet grass
and the warming glow of a far-away lantern was beginning to reflect
onto the metal gate.
There was a tread of footsteps and the warming glow

``Quick, you bumbling baffoon, they'll have us rung up like geese.''
I sharply whispered, pulling him to ear level.
``I say, where's Akbar, we all agreed to meet
at this spot!''.\\\\
``Look to your right, yes, right over there do you see
what I see?'' his hushed voice replied, guiding my trailing eyes.\\\\
And just like that, an angular figure was starting to make out in my mind.
Perhaps, it was the unquiet darkness or the distance between us but
something seemed unsightly about Akbar's appearance.\\
But, Akbar's eyes and body remained fixed, fixed in a way that
made more sense, if a telephone line was attached from one end of
the eye, to the lights that lit up the blanketed sky ahead.\\\\
``Cotton gilled, that's what they are, no concept
of money or saving'' the gruff voice, exclaimed. ``I tell
you if it wasn't for good honest folk, like us, toiling in the fields
all day, you'd think they'd all starve, go mad and eat each other! No but
they don't beca- his voice trailed of.
hell freeze over.
``What's he doing!'' my friend, angrily inquired.
are you sure thats him, yes! look at his clothes.
I saw a long black jacket
``I hate her I snapped''.
Not looking, to have my insides tickled.
What happened to you and the hooker?
Oaf and I were walking towards Akbar discussing it.
He looked like a sneeze.
Why, weren't you seeing a girl from Cathay.
I wasn't sure if it was his choice of clothing
that made it hard to distinguish, of if the farmers
were incapable of turning their heads.
I wasn't sure if he was a scarecrow or not, but it was
almost midnight and I wanted to find my friend.
He looked and stood in a way that made more sense,
 if a permanent telephone line was fixed from one end of the eye to the blanketed
 skies that lay above.
 You fool, thats not Akbar, thats a bloody scarecrow, you daft
 bastard, I ought to leave you here and hope the ravens peck out your eyes
 He had a kind face, but tonight there was a sense of unsighly beautiness to him
 i could have sworn it to be him
