%As I went on my tiptoes scanning the lanky crowd for any small openings, my eardrums were met with a sudden BANG. A heavyset man threw open a glass office door, its plastic glass wobbling from the impact. ``Rui!'' he roared, ``March your butt in my office right now!''. As I struggled to make heads or tails of what was happening I saw a familiar face in the corner of my eye. A small girl approached the office door, clutching a handful of papers to her chest, her pale face was soaked in shame. Her tears were illuminated by the corridor lights and melancholy was written in her face.

%The ancient leather-bound volumes that stacked the shelves, dating from the Norman conquest were of no interest to me. Nor were the lavish paintings, that decorated the walls. Normally deserted, requests for a minimum of 30 people at one time was ignored and the library was overwhelmed with sea of new faces  - all to eager to avoid the biting cold. Even so, I was surprised when the librarian called me to her desk.

%\\\\``Ah, Dr Dawn the reading material you requested finally arrived!'' she whispered, glaring into my dead eyes with a tinge of mischief. The front of her striped shirt was slightly unbottoned revealing her cleavage. I averted my gaze.

%darkest of blacks
%don't make me laugh my soul leaves quicker he says as a smile escapes from his mouth
%Maybe he’s playing a practical joke on me I think, as I reachout  for  his  hand  that  was  stapled  to  his  side  and  grasp  itfirmly, swinging it up and down.  A look of horror consumeshis  face  and  white  threatens  to  swallow  him  whole.  Before  Ihave the chance to slip in a word, I see his thin angular framebecome a dot in the horizon as he runs of frantically.The fuck is wrong with him, probably a loony, I mumble.  Nowait, I forget that thought.  What did he want to say?  Lettingcuriosity get the better of me, I chase after him.Tigthness  begins  to  build  up  in  my  suit  and  I  can  hear  theclick-clacking of my shoes against city tiles.  “Wait, what wasyou gonna say” I yell out, my voice fading in the distance.  Asthe  dot  becomes  smaller  and  smaller,  my  breathing  becomesheavier and heavier.  I think I see him and the-Smack-Bang like a brick wall.  I catch whiff of a rancid smell.Sealing my mouth shut, my eyes are met with a horrid brightblue neon sign.
